Team Profile Generator

The Team Profile Generator allows users to enter a manager, engineers, and interns, and it allows users to view an HTML page with additional details of the employees.  Languages/technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jest, Node.js, and NPM packages.  Several test.js files are used to do tests to confirm the generator works.
